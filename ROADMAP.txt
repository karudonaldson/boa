@=> New Features

   * PHP 8.3 support

   * Symlink all sites files automatically to speed up migration tasks and
     to save tons of disk space.

   * Rsync sites files on clone task to create separate symlinked copy.

   * Debian Bookworm and Devuan Daedalus compatibility for installation and
     automated upgrades.

   * Automate mass import procedure from remote classic Aegir servers running
     Nginx or Apache to extend xboa tool features.

   * Add Amazon S3 alternatives to backboa and duobackboa

@=> Improvements

   * Update and consolidate all legacy and built-in docs into single Grav CMS
     and GIT based site for single point of reference.

@=> Changes and Upgrades

   * Sites backup in Aegir will no longer include all files nor database dump,
     but make it configurable on the fly with new control files if user wants
     to preserve Restore task functionality.

@=> Important Fixes

   * Drush 11/12 support with Redispatch to site-local Drush (vdrush, sdrush)
