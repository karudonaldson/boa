### IMPORTANT!

* Since Debian is running systemd, it should be removed before installing BOA,
  which involves procedure in five steps, as outlined further below.

* Once BOA is fully installed, you have to reboot again and run barracuda
  system upgrade to make sure that the system is ready for production and
  to generate valid SSL/LE/HTTPS certificate for the Aegir control panel.
  Otherwise there will be incomplete web server, dns etc. setup, which will
  cause unexpected problems until you will run barracuda upgrade - after reboot.

* BOA requires minimal, supported OS, with no services installed.
  The only acceptable exceptions are: sshd and mail servers.

* Don't run any installer via sudo.
  You must be logged in as root directly.

* Don't run any system updates before running Barracuda installer.
  You should use vanilla system.

* Once BOA is installed, the server SSH keys will change, so you will need to
  remove relevant lines from your ~/.ssh/known_hosts file and accept new key.

  The next time you will ssh-in, you will see error or it may look like this:

  $ ssh root@server.ip
  @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
  @ WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED! @
  @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
  (...)
  Add correct host key in /home/user/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
  Offending ECDSA key in /home/user/.ssh/known_hosts:51
  ED25519 host key for my.host has changed and you have requested strict checking.
  Host key verification failed.

  How to remove/fix this warning?

  You can either edit the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file on your computer and
  remove only the offending line (51 in the example above), or if you have
  just one or two entries in this file, just delete it, so it will be
  re-generated on the next SSH login attempt once you accept the new SSH key.


### Installing BOA system on a public server/VPS

1. Configure your domain DNS to point its wildcard enabled A record to your
   server IP address, and make sure it propagated on the Internet by trying
   `host server.mydomain.org` or `getent hosts server.mydomain.org` command
   on any other server/system.

   See our DNS wildcard configuration example for reference: http://bit.ly/UM2nRb

   NOTE! You shouldn't use anything like "mydomain.org" as your hostname.
         It should be some **subdomain**, like "server.mydomain.org".

   You **don't** need to configure your hostname (on the server) before
   running BOA installer, since BOA will do that for you, automatically.

2. Please read docs/NOTES.txt for other related details.

3. Download and run BOA Meta Installer.

   $ cd;wget -q -U iCab http://files.aegir.cc/BOA.sh.txt;bash BOA.sh.txt

4. Remove systemd in five steps:

   S1. Run 'boa init' command -- it will install sysvinit.
   S2. Reboot the server.
   S3. Run 'boa init' again so it can remove systemd.
   S4. Reboot the server again.
   S5. Run boa standard install command, as outlined below.

5. Install Barracuda and Octopus.

   NOTE: always start with screen session!

   $ screen

   You must specify the kind of install with {in-head|in-dev} or for
   legacy versions with {in-3.2|in-2.4}, location with {local|public},
   your hostname and email address, as shown further below.

   Specifying Octopus username is optional. It will use "o1" if empty.

   The one before last part {ask|mini|max|none} is optional, if you wish
   to control Octopus platforms install mode, as explained below.
   Note that "none" is a special option you can use to not install any
   built-in platform, while "ask" is a default mode if you don't specify
   this option at all.

   The last {newrelickey|php-7.4|php-8.1|php-all|nodns} part is
   optional and can be used either to install New Relic Apps Monitor (you should
   replace the "newrelickey" keyword with a valid license key), or to define
   single PHP version to install and use both for Master and Satellite instances.
   When "php-all" is defined, then all available versions will be installed,
   but 7.4 will be used by default. You can later install or modify PHP version
   used via _PHP_MULTI_INSTALL, _PHP_CLI_VERSION and _PHP_FPM_VERSION, but
   the _PHP_SINGLE_INSTALL variable must be set empty to not override other
   related variables. The "nodns" option allows to skip DNS and SMTP checks.

   # Latest on public server - prompt for every platform install
   $ boa in-head public server.mydomain.org my@email o1

   # Latest on public server - no prompt with 3xD6 + 3xD7 only
   $ boa in-head public server.mydomain.org my@email o1 mini

   # Latest on public server - no prompt with all platforms and New Relic
   $ boa in-head public server.mydomain.org my@email o1 max newrelickey

   To install Legacy version instead of Latest, use the same commands, but
   replace "in-head" with "in-3.2" or "in-2.4".

   Note that once you will install current Latest or DEV, you can't
   downgrade back to Legacy version!


### Installing BOA system on localhost

1. Please read docs/NOTES.txt

2. Download and run BOA Meta Installer.

   $ cd;wget -q -U iCab http://files.aegir.cc/BOA.sh.txt;bash BOA.sh.txt

3. Install Barracuda and Octopus.

   You must specify the kind of install with {in-head|in-dev},
   location with {local|public}, and your email address,
   as shown below. For local installs you don't need to specify
   hostname and Octopus username, as it is fully automated.

   The last {ask|mini|max|none} part is optional, if you wish to control
   Octopus platforms install mode, as explained below.

   You can also specify PHP version to install, as shown in examples below.
   The {php-7.4|php-all} argument can be either added
   after {ask|mini|max|none} or specified instead of {ask|mini|max|none}

   # Latest on localhost - prompt for every platform install
   $ boa in-head local my@email

   # Latest on localhost - prompt for every platform + install all PHP versions
   $ boa in-head local my@email php-all

   # Latest on localhost - no prompt with 3xD6 + 3xD7 only + single PHP version
   $ boa in-head local my@email mini php-7.4

   # Latest on localhost - no prompt with all platforms installed
   $ boa in-head local my@email max

   To install DEV instead of Latest, use the same commands, but
   replace "in-head" with "in-dev" (DEV should be used only for development)

   To install Legacy version instead of Latest, use the same commands, but
   replace "in-head" with "in-3.2" or "in-2.4".

   The oldest Legacy version (in-2.2) is the last Edition in the 2.2.x series
   which still supported Drupal 5 and used Drush 4 along with old Aegir version.
   Note that once you have current Latest or DEV installed, you can't
   go back to any legacy version.


### Installing more Octopus instances

It is now possible to add stable, head or legacy 2.4 Octopus instances w/o
forcing Barracuda upgrade, plus optionally with no platforms added by default:

   $ boa {in-octopus} {email} {o2} {mini|max|none} {head|dev|2.4}

If {head|dev|2.4} is not specified, it will use the Latest (head).
